🌟 CSE 212 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Hey there! Welcome to my learning journey through Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm documenting my progress as I work through various programming concepts and challenges in C#.

📚 About This Repository
This is my personal workspace for CSE 212 where I'm exploring fundamental computer science concepts through hands-on coding. Each week brings new challenges that help me understand how to write efficient, scalable code.

🗂️ Weekly Progress
Week 1: Dynamic Arrays
What I'm learning: The difference between static arrays and dynamic lists in C#, and when to use each one.

Key Concepts:

Arrays vs List<T> - choosing the right tool for the job

Memory management and performance considerations

Practical problem-solving with array manipulation

Featured Code:

Multiples Generator: Creating sequences of numbers programmatically

List Rotation: Efficiently rearranging data in collections

💡 My Approach
I believe in learning by doing. For each assignment:

I start by planning my solution with detailed comments

Implement the code step by step

Test thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected

Reflect on what I've learned and how I can improve

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C#

Framework: .NET 8.0

Testing: MSTest

IDE: Visual Studio Code

🎯 Current Focus
Right now I'm diving deep into:

Understanding time and space complexity

Choosing the right data structures for different scenarios

Writing clean, maintainable code

Preparing for technical interviews

🌱 Learning Mindset
I'm embracing the challenge of learning complex topics by breaking them down into manageable pieces. Some days are about big breakthroughs, other days are about fixing small bugs - and both are valuable parts of the journey.
